# Aedes albopictus SNP Chip Analysis

This repository contains the code and resources to replicate the analysis for the AUT line conducted using the Aedes albopictus SNP chip data. The analysis covers a range of genomic investigations, including quality control, selection scans, functional annotation, and more.

## Project Overview

The analysis is divided into several stages, each producing specific output files. Below is an overview of each stage and the corresponding files:
